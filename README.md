## Database Schema

### Tables

#### mindmaps
Stores mindmap metadata and basic information.
```sql
CREATE TABLE mindmaps (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### nodes
Individual nodes with content, position, and hierarchical structure.
```sql
CREATE TABLE nodes (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    mindmap_id UUID REFERENCES mindmaps(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    position_x FLOAT NOT NULL,
    position_y FLOAT NOT NULL,
    parent_id UUID REFERENCES nodes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    is_root BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    handle_config JSONB,
    width INTEGER DEFAULT 150,
    height INTEGER DEFAULT 50,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### edges
Connections between nodes in the mindmap.
```sql
CREATE TABLE edges (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    mindmap_id UUID REFERENCES mindmaps(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    source_id UUID REFERENCES nodes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    target_id UUID REFERENCES nodes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    source_handle VARCHAR(255),
    target_handle VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```






### Relationships
- **mindmaps** ‚Üí **nodes** (one-to-many): A mindmap contains multiple nodes
- **nodes** ‚Üí **nodes** (self-referencing): Nodes can have parent-child relationships
- **nodes** ‚Üí **edges** (one-to-many): Nodes can have multiple connections
